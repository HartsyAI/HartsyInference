# Changelog

## alpha.405

- Kimi K3.1 Pro (`kimi_k31`): CPU reference for the KDA forget gate, the KDA recurrence and output, the latent MoE
  order, the routing rule, and attention residuals, with the SiTU activation shared with the GLU reference.
- Expert-parallel dispatch host reference (`ExpertParallelDispatch`): contiguous expert ownership, route planning,
  send counts, and a combine that matches a single-device evaluation.
- MXFP4 checkpoint branch in `HfQuantCheckpoint` for the `mxfp4-pack-quantized` routed-expert tensors.
