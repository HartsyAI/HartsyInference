## alpha.405

- **Added: CoLa3D scene decomposition.** `hartsy 3d <scene.obj|glb> -m cola3d --model-path <Models>` and `POST /v1/native/mesh`
  (model `cola3d`, `sceneMesh = {data, format}`) split a triangle scene into one mesh node per object and return one GLB. The
  chain is dual-grid voxelization, the shape VAE encoder, Utonia point features, the CoLa3D decomposer, then per-object shape VAE
  decoding and dual-grid meshing. The grid defaults to 256 and is capped at 1024 (`--grid`, dual-grid voxels per axis, a
  multiple of 16).
- **Added: OBJ and GLB scene readers.** `ObjReader` splits fields on any whitespace and warns once per record type it does not
  read. `GlbReader` places each primitive by its node transform, so objects positioned by their nodes come out in world space.
  It refuses malformed, sparse and buffer-less accessors with a domain error. `GlbWriter` writes several meshes into one scene.
- **Fixed: a CoLa3D run that is cancelled or fails releases every object latent it has not decoded yet.**
